# JavaScript Null Value Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript when dealing with `null` values and provides a solution.

## The Bug
The `bug.js` file contains a function that attempts to add two numbers. However, it directly returns `null` if either input is `null`. This is a simplistic approach and might not be suitable in all cases.  A more robust approach should consider how to handle null values based on the specific needs of the application, perhaps by using default values or throwing an error.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a more robust solution to handle `null` values, using a more thoughtful approach. 

## How to run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open the `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` files in your preferred JavaScript environment.
3. Run the code to observe the different outputs and compare the solutions.
